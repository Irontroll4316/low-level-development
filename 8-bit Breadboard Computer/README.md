# 8-bit Breadboard Computer

This project has helped me learn so much about several different topics. These include: 
1. Reading Schematics and Data Sheets
2. Using EEPROMs to simplify combinatorial logic
3. Creating an assembly language to convert useful instructions into microinstructions
4. Using central control logic to coordinate the various components to do useful computarion
5. Troubleshooting different electrical and logical issues
